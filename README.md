*   fetch and save to the database id of repository (to handle situation with project rename)
*   automatically update information about projects (number of watchers, name, description)
*   unsubscribe from tips for commits to particular projects
*   (?) secure bitcoin storage (offline storage? multisig addresses?)
*   sort by watchers/balance in the list of projects
*   (?) enable project maintainers to customize tips via merge comments (e.g. label improvement as #tiny, #small, #average, #large or #huge)
*   (?) bitbucket support

tasks marked as (?) need to be thought over
